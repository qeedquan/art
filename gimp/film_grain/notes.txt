1. Desaturate the image to make it grayscale
2. Make another layer, use cell noise and adjust the cell size so it looks like white noise but smoother.
3. Move the noise layer above the image layer, merge it using Grain Merge.
4. Duplicate the noise layer the number of times you want to chain the effect
